# Project Details

## [Network Performance Insight](https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/community/wikis/home?lang=en#!/wiki/W3f051a61d14f_4538_b5bc_58a898795a21) (NPI)

NPI is the next generation network performance management software that deploys with the [IBM Netcool Operations Insight](http://www-03.ibm.com/software/products/en/netcool-operations-insight) (NOI) as a full blown Enterprise Network Operation Support System (OSS) solution.

#### Scope / Responsibility
1. Product features development / implementation
2. Built Verification Test (BVT) automation deployment and maintenance

#### Contribution Highlights
1. **Product Features Developed / Implemented**
    + Storage Optimizer Enhacement
        * Improved persistent storage pruning policy to execute computation based on file committed timestamp to allow delayed storage optimization use case
        * Isolated optimization `Scan` and `Delete` code path to make enablement as user configurable
    + SBT Build Code Enhancement
        * Updated with [`ClasspathJarPlugin`](http://sbt-native-packager.readthedocs.io/en/latest/recipes/longclasspath.html#generate-a-classpath-jar) to resolve classpath ordering and long classpath issues
    + JDBC Driver Implementation
        * Based on Apache Calcite and Avatica. Click [here](#apache-calcite-avatica) for more informaiton.
        * Implementation includes reference to [SQL-92 Gramma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL-92) and [Oracle Java JDBC Specification](http://download.oracle.com/otndocs/jcp/jdbc-4_1-mrel-spec/index.html)
    + Multi [Node](http://doc.akka.io/docs/akka/snapshot/dev/multi-jvm-testing.html) / [JVM](http://doc.akka.io/docs/akka/snapshot/dev/multi-node-testing.html) Test Specification for Clustering Feature
        * Developed test code to launch clustering test scenario to reduce physical hardware dependency
    + Storage Writer
        * Implemented `RAW` and `Aggregation` data writers based on [Akka Actor](http://akka.io/) with distributed computing capabilities and honoring the concept of actor-based concurrency to improve efficiency with multiple write paths availabilty

2. **Automated BVT Ecosystem**
    + As background, with Jenkins; Launch product components as Docker Containers, including installation and configurations; External data injection via in-house developed utilities; Execute End-to-End test code written with [Scala Test](http://www.scalatest.org/) framework; Consolidate results as J-Unit reports; Tear down / clean up ecosystem for next run
    + Improved development and operation (DevOps) cycles
        * Improved product build quaility as more bugs are captured before build is picked up by Quality Assurance(QA) Team
        * Automated ecosystem reduces cost for executing BVT activities

### TNPM Wireline Prove-Of-Concept (POC)

New business opportunities for TNPM around South-East Asia region by [Globe Telecom](https://www.globe.com.ph/) (Phillipines) and [TrueMove](http://truemoveh.truecorp.co.th/?ln=en) (Thailand).

#### Scope / Responsibility
1. TNPM POC system preparation according to Requet For Proposal (RFP) use cases
2. Demostration / presentation / Walk-through with potential use groups
3. Collaborate with on site teams to execute product integration (e.g. Fault Management, Dashboard User Interface) and data stiching (e.g. Inventory enrichment)

#### Contribution Highlights
1. Implemented configurations and topologies to process performance data from Live Devices including enterprise level groupings for data aggregation and report nagivation with customized and personalized Cognos Reports
2. Integrated [TNPM DataView](https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSBNJ7_1.3.2/com.ibm.tnpm.doc/DataView/ctnpm_dv_userguide.html) into a common [IBM Dashboard Application Service Hub instance](https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/community/groups/service/html/communitystart?communityUuid=b8caedd7-3aca-41c1-a9c1-7be87a51c50e) as part of unified user interface use cases
3. Integrated [TNPM DataChannel](http://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSBNJ7_1.4.1/install/ctnpm_installguide_tivolinetcoolperformancemanagerarchitecture-03-02.html) with [IBM Tivoli Netcool/OMNIbus](http://www-03.ibm.com/software/products/en/ibmtivolinetcoolomnibus) for SNMP Trap processing and consolidation as part of fault management use cases
4. Integrated [TNPM Mass Data Extraction](https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSBNJ7_1.3.2/com.ibm.tnpm.doc/pdf/pdf_tnpm_mass_data_extraction.pdf) with [IBM Operation Analytics - Predictive Insights](http://www-03.ibm.com/software/products/en/ibm-operations-analytics---predictive-insights) for fault prediction relation modelling based on historical data

### [TNPM Data Provider](https://www-304.ibm.com/software/brandcatalog/ismlibrary/details?catalog.label=1TW10NP6I)

The [TNPM architecture](https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSBNJ7_1.4.0/com.ibm.tnpm_1.4_kc.doc/quick_start/tnpm_1.4_quick_start_guide.html) includes both Wireline and Wireless components. Each delivers as separated data source. The TNPM Data Provider is a common RESTful API that produce unified data which enables data federation possibilities.

#### Scope / Responsibility
1. Resposible for the design of APIs and scope of features
2. Implement POC and conduct requirement screening for various business use cases
3. Develop as a product that fits into the TNPM solution ecosystem

#### Contribution Highlights
1. The eventual solution is a common RESTful interface that is installed into IBM WebSphere Application Server (WAS) via automated installer that consumes data from both Wireline and Wireless realms based on JDBC semantics and expose the unified data as JSON
2. Implemented single point installer that orchastrates installation and configuration into WAS to reduce installation and uninstallation overhead

### [TNPM Alcatel-Lucent (ALU) 5620 SAM LogToFile](http://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSBNJ7_1.3.2/com.ibm.tnpm_tp13J.doc/pack_rel_notes/ctnpm_relnotes_alcatel-lucent5620sam_logtofile2.1.0.0_tech_pak.html)

SAM is an enteprise end-to-end, multi-domain network and service management software. The former TNPM solution process both the `Performance` (e.g. CPU, MEM) and `Accounting` (e.g. Bandwidth, Utilization) data based on the `FindToFile` semantics. ALU advocates OSS clients to use the `LogToFile` method for greater scalability. IBM InforSphere DataStage is used as an interface to SAM to produce data in multiple streams followed by network modelling tasks by TNPM.

#### Scope / Responsibility
1. Re-designed and re-implemented the [TNPM UBA Bulk Collectors](http://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSBNJ7_1.4.1/bulk_collector/c_tnpm_bcol_intro_tnpmcollectortypes.html) to adapt new data schemas
2. Ensure successful end-to-end solution integration, from SAM to reporting level (e.g. TNPM DataView, Cognos Reporting)
3. Support deployments and defects raised by customers

#### Contribution Highlights
1. With multiple data streams from IBM InforSphere Datastage and TNPM multiple collector topology capabilities have increased overall processing throughput that satisfies customer requirements for network growth
2. Participated in ALU and PSL joint venture product certification activity within ALU facility (Ottawa, Canada), achieving 80% passing rate
3. Successful production rollout for [Telus](http://www.telus.com) (Canada)
