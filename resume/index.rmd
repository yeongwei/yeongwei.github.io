        * Implemented test code for launching cluster test scenario to reduce physical hardware dependency
    + Storage Writer
        * Implemented `RAW` and `Aggregation` data writers based on [Akka Actor](http://akka.io/) to support distributed computing capabilities with the actor-based concurrency design.

2. **Automated BVT Ecosystem**
    + Background, Jenkins to launch product components as Docker Containers, including installation and configurations; Feed data via data injection tool developed in-house; Execute End-to-End test implemented with [Scala Test](http://www.scalatest.org/) framework; Consolidate results as J-Unit reports; Followed by tear down / clean up.
    + Improved development and operation (DevOps) cycles.
        * Improved product build quality with bugs captured before build was released to Quality Assurance (QA) team.
        * Automated ecosystem reduces cost for executing BVT activities.

#### Scope / Responsibility
1. Prepared TNPM POC system according to Request For Proposal (RFP) use cases.
2. Demo-ed / Presented / Walked-through with potential user groups.
3. Collaborated with on-site teams to execute product integration (e.g. Fault Management, Dashboard User Interface) and data stitching (e.g. Inventory enrichment).

#### Contribution Highlights
1. Implemented custom configurations and topologies to process performance data from live devices including enterprise level groupings creation for data aggregation, custom report navigation and personalized Cognos Reports.
2. Integrated [TNPM DataView](https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSBNJ7_1.3.2/com.ibm.tnpm.doc/DataView/ctnpm_dv_userguide.html) into a common [IBM Dashboard Application Service Hub instance](https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/community/groups/service/html/communitystart?communityUuid=b8caedd7-3aca-41c1-a9c1-7be87a51c50e) as part of unified user interface use case.
3. Integrated [TNPM DataChannel](http://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSBNJ7_1.4.1/install/ctnpm_installguide_tivolinetcoolperformancemanagerarchitecture-03-02.html) with [IBM Tivoli Netcool/OMNIbus](http://www-03.ibm.com/software/products/en/ibmtivolinetcoolomnibus) for SNMP Trap processing as part of fault management use case.
4. Integrated TNPM with [IBM Operation Analytics - Predictive Insights](http://www-03.ibm.com/software/products/en/ibm-operations-analytics---predictive-insights) via [Mass Data Extraction](https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSBNJ7_1.3.2/com.ibm.tnpm.doc/pdf/pdf_tnpm_mass_data_extraction.pdf) for fault prediction use case.

### [TNPM Data Provider](https://www-304.ibm.com/software/brandcatalog/ismlibrary/details?catalog.label=1TW10NP6I)

[TNPM](https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSBNJ7_1.4.0/com.ibm.tnpm_1.4_kc.doc/quick_start/tnpm_1.4_quick_start_guide.html) product includes both Wireline and Wireless domains. Each delivers data as separated source. The TNPM Data Provider is a common RESTful API that produce unified data as data federation layer.

#### Scope / Responsibility
1. Produced design and scope of features.
2. Implemented POC and conducted requirement screening for useful business use case.
3. Developed features that fits into the TNPM solution ecosystem.

#### Contribution Highlights

### [TNPM Alcatel-Lucent (ALU) 5620 SAM LogToFile](http://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSBNJ7_1.3.2/com.ibm.tnpm_tp13J.doc/pack_rel_notes/ctnpm_relnotes_alcatel-lucent5620sam_logtofile2.1.0.0_tech_pak.html)

ALU SAM is an enterprise end-to-end, multi-domain network and service management software. The former TNPM solution process both the `Performance` (e.g. CPU, MEM) and `Accounting` (e.g. Bandwidth, Utilization) data based on the `FindToFile` method. ALU advocates moving forward for OSS clients to use the `LogToFile` method for greater scalability. IBM InfoSphere DataStage (DataStage) as an interface to SAM for multiple data streams followed by network data modelling in TNPM.
