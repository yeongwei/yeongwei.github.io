# Project Details

## [Network Performance Insight](https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/community/wikis/home?lang=en#!/wiki/W3f051a61d14f_4538_b5bc_58a898795a21) (NPI)

NPI is the next generation network performance management software that is bundled together with the [IBM Netcool Operations Insight](http://www-03.ibm.com/software/products/en/netcool-operations-insight) (NOI) delivered as an Enterprise Network Operation Support System (OSS) solution.

#### Scope / Responsibility
1. Product development
2. Automated End-to-end Built Verification Test (BVT) deployment and maintenance

#### Contribution Highlights
1. **Product Features Developed / Implemented**
    + Kafka Schema Registry
    + Storage Optimizer Enhancement
        * Improved storage file pruning policy to execute pruning logic based on file committed timestamp for delayed storage optimization use case
        * Isolated optimization `Scan` and `Delete` path to make optimization enablement as user configurable parameter
    + SBT Build Code Enhancement
        * Using [`ClasspathJarPlugin`](http://sbt-native-packager.readthedocs.io/en/latest/recipes/longclasspath.html#generate-a-classpath-jar) to resolve classpath ordering and long classpath issues
    + JDBC Driver Implementation
        * Based on Apache Calcite and Avatica. Click [here](#apache-calcite-avatica) for more information.
        * Implementation to comply with [SQL-92 Gramma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL-92) and [Oracle Java JDBC Specification](http://download.oracle.com/otndocs/jcp/jdbc-4_1-mrel-spec/index.html)
    + Multi [Node](http://doc.akka.io/docs/akka/snapshot/dev/multi-jvm-testing.html) / [JVM](http://doc.akka.io/docs/akka/snapshot/dev/multi-node-testing.html) Test Specification for Clustering Feature
        * Implemented test code for launching cluster test scenario to reduce physical hardware dependency
    + Storage Writer
        * Implemented `RAW` and `Aggregation` data writers based on [Akka Actor](http://akka.io/) for distributed computing capabilities and honoring the concept of actor-based concurrency design to improve efficiency with the availability of multiple write paths

2. **Automated BVT Ecosystem**
    + As background, Jenkins launches product components as Docker Containers, including installation and configurations; Invoke external data injection developed in-house; Execute End-to-End test written with [Scala Test](http://www.scalatest.org/) framework; Consolidate results as J-Unit reports; Followed by tear down / clean up ecosystem for next run
    + Improved development and operation (DevOps) cycles
        * Improved product build quality as more bugs are captured before build is released to Quality Assurance (QA) team
        * Automated ecosystem reduces cost for executing BVT activities

### [TNPM Data Provider](https://www-304.ibm.com/software/brandcatalog/ismlibrary/details?catalog.label=1TW10NP6I)

The [TNPM architecture](https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSBNJ7_1.4.0/com.ibm.tnpm_1.4_kc.doc/quick_start/tnpm_1.4_quick_start_guide.html) includes both Wireline and Wireless components. Each delivers data as separated source. The TNPM Data Provider is a common RESTful API that produce unified data which enables data federation.
